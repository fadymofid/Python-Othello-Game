# Othello-Board-Game
Othello is a strategy board game for two players,
played on an 8Ã—8 uncheckered board. Two players
compete, using 64 identical game pieces ("disks")
that are white on one side and black on the other.
Each player chooses one color to use throughout
the game. Players take turns placing one disk on an
empty square, with their assigned color facing up.
After a play is made, any disks of the opponent's
color that lie in a straight line bounded by the one
just played and another one in the current player's
color are turned over. When all playable empty
squares are filled, the player with more disks
showing in their own color wins the game.
